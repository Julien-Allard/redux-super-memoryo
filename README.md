A simple memory game with the Mario Theme. You got 16 cards and have to find the 8 pairs before the timer runs out.
Made with React and Redux.

## Features :

- front-end made with React
- better state management thanks to Redux store and reducers (Redux Toolkit)
- use of the AirBnB config for ESLint for optimal code practices and PropTypes
- unit testing with Jest and react-testing-library
- better folder tree
- will get better with time (TypeScript, unit testing)
- best score saved on localStorage.
